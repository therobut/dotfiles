# Robut's dotfiles

## Installation

At the moment, only debian-based systems are supported. It is easy to add other package managers besides apt, I just don't
use them, and can't be bothered. These are my personal dotfiles, after all. Feel free to open a PR.

**ZSH must already be installed**

Simply clone this repository to `~/dotfiles` (hardcoded at the moment, sorry), then run
```
./setup.sh
```
